const FAQS = [
    {
        question: "Will this sound robotic or is it actually human-like?",
        answer: "This isn't a basic chatbot or DIY tool, it's an end-to-end done-for-you system. We train the AI on YOUR successful conversations (your tone, language, style), so it sounds exactly like you, not a generic bot.",
        icon: MessageCircle
    },
    {
        question: "Is Instagram DM automation safe? Will my account get banned?",
        answer: "100% safe. We use Meta's official Instagram Graph API, fully compliant with Instagram's terms. We only access Instagram messages, nothing else from your account.",
        icon: ShieldCheck
    },
    {
        question: "How much setup time do I need to invest?",
        answer: "Zero. This is a totally done-for-you service, one 30-minute kickoff call to understand your offer, and we handle everything else. You're live in 3 days.",
        icon: Clock
    },
    {
        question: "What happens to my existing leads/customers during the transition?",
        answer: "Nothing changes for them, they still message you normally on Instagram. We just handle the replies behind the scenes, so conversations feel seamless and uninterrupted.",
        icon: Users
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from hiring a VA?",
        answer: "VAs work limited hours and need constant management. With our system, you get 24/7 availability with zero management, plus pre-call intelligence that shows you exactly who's serious before you even say hello, VAs can't provide that level of insight.",
        icon: Zap
    },
    {
        question: "How do you qualify leads? What stops unqualified people from booking?",
        answer: "The system automatically sorts every lead into three categories: qualified (ready to buy), unqualified (not a fit), or freebie-seekers. You only see qualified prospects on your calendar, the rest get nurtured or exited appropriately.",
        icon: HelpCircle
    },
    {
        question: "What if I want to handle a DM myself or talk to someone personally?",
        answer: "You have full control. Switch between \"handle by system\" and \"handle manually\" anytime with one click. Once you're done with manual handling, click back to system mode, complete flexibility.",
        icon: ToggleRight
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from ManyChat, chatbots, or other DM automation tools?",
        answer: "Tools like ManyChat and chatbots require you to build, manage, and fix everything yourself (10-15 hours monthly). We're a complete done-for-you service, trained on YOUR conversations, fully managed, continuously optimized, you do zero work.",
        icon: Layers
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to manage or monitor the system daily?",
        answer: "No. This is completely hands-off, we handle replies, qualification, follow-ups, and optimization. You just review the dashboard when convenient and take qualified calls. Zero daily management required.",
        icon: EyeOff
    },

    {
        question: "What if I get 500 DMs one month and 50 the next? Do I pay more?",
        answer: "No. Same fixed price regardless of volume fluctuations, unlike other service agencies that charge per contact or per message. You pay one flat rate whether you get 10 or 500 DMs.",
